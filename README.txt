Map Viewer is a program designed for setting the Axe and Boat items from the game, Diamond Hunter, onto the map of Diamond Hunter. Once the Axe and Boat items are set on the map in Map Viewer, the items are able to be interacted with in Diamond Hunter itself. 

How to run Map Viewer:
1. Navigate to .jar file for Map Viewer and click on it.
2. To run Diamond Hunter through Map Viewer, click Start Map button in the program.

IMPORTANT: Before running the Map Viewer code, install the gomarice.tff font in order to properly display the text in the program as there are problems with installing the font manually via CSS in Java 8.

How to use Map Viewer:
1. To set the Axe item on the map, click on "Place Axe" button then click on any one of the Grass tile.
2. To set the Boat item on the map, click on "Place Boat" button then click on any one of the Grass tile.
3. Only a single Axe and/or Boat item can be set on the map.
4. To save the positions of the Axe and Boat items on the map, click the "Save Map" button
5. To set the positions of the Axe and Boat back to their default positions on the map, click the "Reset to default" button
6. Click "Display Gridlines" to clearly see the outline of each tile on the map. Use this to more accurately place the Axe and Boat item on the map
7. Diamond Hunter can be started directly through Map Viewer by clicking on the "Start Game" button. Doing so will close Map Viewer and start Diamond Hunter.
8. Before starting the map, make sure to click "Save Map" so that the Axe and Boat items in Diamond Hunter will appear in the locations that you set on the map.
